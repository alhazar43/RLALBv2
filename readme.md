# RLALB v2

This project is a rework of the RLALB project for my MSc thesis. My blueprint projects:

- Multi-objective RL (PPO Maybe) Thus reward enforcing different metrics
- Ensemble learning for GAT to learn the invalid action mask
- Some level of explainability

### Progress check

- [x] Parsing old instances
- [ ] Parser/solver pipeline
- [ ] `torch` to replace `tf`
- [ ] Multi-objective (short vs long term trade-off)
- [ ] Solution interpreter
- [ ] <s>Stochastic variant or ERALBP</s>
