# RLALB v2

This project is a rework of the RLALB project for my MSc thesis. My blueprint projects:

- A shift from Tensorflow to Pytorch for models
- Multi-objective RL (PPO Maybe) Thus reward enforcing different metrics
- Some level of explainability

### Progress check

- [x] Prepare instances in prior works
- [ ] Parser/solver pipeline
- [ ] torch to replace tf
- [ ] MOPPO, or double Q
- [ ] Solution interpreter
- [ ] <s>Stochastic variant or ERALBP</s>
